    "We know that software has traditionally been hard to write and even harder to maintain. \n",

    "Back in the 1970s, people thought about this a lot. One of them is named Alan Kay. He thought about how to create a programming language that would make it easier to write code, and also easier to understand/maintain code. One of this thoughts was that we could create software like a biological system -- those systems are made up of cells, with each type of cell performing a different job. What if we could create different types of \"cells\" in our code, each defined very clearly, and then assemble our software from these different types of cells, depending on what functionality we wanted?\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the beginning of object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, we talk about \"objects\"\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, we talk about \"classes\" (or \"types\")f\n",
    "- Cells send messages to one another to pass information -- in object-oriented programming, we use \"methods\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay invented a language called Smalltalk that implemented this. Smalltalk never really took off as a language. But its influence is everywhere, because nearly every modern programming language is object-oriented in some way or another. This is because objects are generally seen as making our code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is *not* a panacea for all software problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a technique for managing and organizing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you always need to use objects? Python says \"no,\" that it's a good and useful technique, but you don't need to use it everywhere. However, the underlying Python language uses objects everywhere... if you understand how objects work in Python, then you also have a better understanding of how the language itself works, and how to use it."

A class is a factory for objects of that type, or (phrased differently) for instances of that type. Everything in Python is an object, so everything is an instance of some type. What type? We just have to use the `type` function to find out.\n",
    "- `object` -- this word is overused in the world of object-oriented programming. It basically means \"a value.\" Sometimes, when we say \"object,\" we mean \"any value in Python.\" Sometimes, we mean \"an instance of a type.\" I can say that `s` is a \"string object,\" or I can say that it's an \"instance of `str`.\" Both are acceptable.

    "# What is `self`? What is `__init__`, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people believe that `__init__` is the \"constructor method\" for an object in Python -- meaning, that it creates a new object. This is absolutely, 100% false.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__` doesn't create the new object. (That's done by a special method called `__new__` behind the scenes.) Rather, `__init__` is invoked after the object has been created, but before it has been returned to the caller. `__init__` is passed any and all arguments we passed to the class. When I invoked `Person('Reuven')`, `__init__` eventually got that argument, `'Reuven'` passed to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for `__init__` to have a way to modify the newly created object, it gets that object passed to it automatically as the first argument. In fact, *every* method in Python gets the instance passed to it as the first argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that every method needs one more parameter than you might think. The first parameter will always be the instance on which we're running things. While you can use any name you want for that parameter, everyone in the Python world has standardized on the name `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you define a method without `self`, then the first parameter will still get the instance assigned to it, no matter its name. This might well result in an error, because you didn't provide enough parameters.\n",
    "- If your class doesn't need to assign any attributes on the object, then you don't need to define `__init__`."
